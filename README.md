Hello FiveM Community, here is it - FCV V2.0.0.

This script was originally requested from and developed by @murfasa.

I'm updating the script to add real commands as FiveM allows and adding two more features, namely /dirt to make the vehicle dirty and /destroy to destroy the engine, tires and ~~gas tank~~ this feature requires more work than I can provide or in-depth testing.

Also, the main reason is I want to backup this and also share with people who actually wants an updated and upgraded version of the original script.
